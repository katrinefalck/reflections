1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working on a project with other people, or from several computers.

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you might want to review changes before pulling them to the local repository.

3) Describe the difference between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A forks is a kind of "clone" of another person's work on GitHub, that you add as your own reposatory to be able to edit, but there is still a connection to the original one. 
A clone is a copy of another repository.
Branches are found within a repository - e.g. when adding a new feature or experimenting with a project.

4) What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

If the connection to the remote state fails, it is still possible to correct the state.
