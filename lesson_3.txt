1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working on a project with other people, or from several computers.

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you might want to review changes before pulling them to the local repository.
