1) What happens when you initialize a repository Why do you need it?

It starts saving the progress of the history of files. Now commits can be saved and changes reviewed.

2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area makes it possible to define different relationships and changes in the working directory, before it is added to the repository. It add the value to create different connections.

3) How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Because you can compare the new stages to previous commits. If the change is not a logical change, the diff comparison will show. The diff will also tell of the commit contains more than one logical change.

4) What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

For example if the program needs to be made into a different language, or if different modes to a games should be added (like easy-mode)

5) How do the diagrams help you vizualize the branch structure?
It shows how the different branches are connected, as well as in with commit a branch is created. --> So it shows which commits are "related" and which are not (in different branches)
